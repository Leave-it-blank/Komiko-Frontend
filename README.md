# Getting Started with Komiko Frontend

This Project is a sample project which implements a basic frontend for comic reading webapp.
It currently uses fake data to fill the pages and is not connected to any backend.
You can also comment out fetch inside the loader and remove fakedata from it to use the backend. 
Backend is not included in this repo.
